Hereâ€™s the complete list of commands for encrypting a file using LUKS based on the notes from the images:

### Step 1: Identify the USB Device
```bash
lsblk
```

### Step 2: Create a Partition on the USB Device
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```
(Replace `/dev/sdb` with your USB device name.)

Inside `fdisk`:
- To list existing partitions:  
  ```bash
  p
  ```
- To delete existing partitions:  
  ```bash
  d
  ```
- To create a new partition:  
  ```bash
  n
  ```
  - Choose `p` for primary partition.  
  - Choose partition number `1`.  
  - Press `Enter` for default values.  
  - Press `w` to save and exit.

### Step 3: Encrypt the Partition with LUKS
1. Install `cryptsetup` if not installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install cryptsetup
   ```
2. Initialize LUKS encryption on the partition:
   ```bash
   sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb
   ```
   (Replace `/dev/sdb` with the partition created above.)

3. Open the encrypted partition:
   ```bash
   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb encrypted_usb
   ```

4. Format the encrypted partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/encrypted_usb
   ```

### Step 4: Mount the Encrypted Partition
1. Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/encrypted_usb
   ```
2. Mount the encrypted partition:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/mapper/encrypted_usb /mnt/encrypted_usb
   ```

### Step 5: Unmount the Encrypted Partition
1. Unmount:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/encrypted_usb
   ```
2. Close the encrypted partition:
   ```bash
   sudo cryptsetup luksClose encrypted_usb
   ```

### Step 6: Add Files to the Encrypted Partition
1. Open the encrypted partition:
   ```bash
   sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb/ encrypted_usb
   ```

2. Mount it again:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/mapper/encrypted_usb /mnt/encrypted_usb
   ```

3. Copy files:
   ```bash
   cp /home/kali/Desktop/1.jpg /mnt/encrypted_usb
   ```

This completes the steps to encrypt, mount, and add files to the encrypted USB partition. Let me know if you need help with any specific step.
